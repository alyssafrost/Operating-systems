# CS 433 - Homework 1

Hello Jan!

I hope that you enjoy reviewing this work. 
There are some interesting brain fart comments that I left because they might have been more resourceful to see what I was thinking about moreso than me going through and verbosely elaborating every single line. Let me know if you need more information on anything.

In order to compile and run `hw1.c`, you will need to do the following:
```bash
gcc hw1.c
./a.out <included keywords you wish to have counted> < test.txt
```
I hope that this is helpful, and if you'd like to make your own text file to test, feel free to do so!
