// TODO: Create functionality for an optional terminal input being provided from the user -- flags are assumed to be correct

    // int main(int argc, char **argv)
   
// TODO: Implement a queue that we can add our jobs to, to be threaded to our "execution"
// TODO: Implement a "submit" job -- or an executable being run, such as "hw3.c" is an executable"
// TODO: Implement a "show jobs" option that allows you to print and list out all jobs both running, and waiting
